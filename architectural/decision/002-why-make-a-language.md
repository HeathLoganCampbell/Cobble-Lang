# ADR-002: Why make a lanuge

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I read the book Domain Driven design and realised that there is a mismatch between the tools and the 
domain driven designing. As well as there is a few features I like from a bunch of different lanugaes
that would be cool to bring together.

* It'll likely never be used in production.
* I want to practice TDD
* I want to practice DDD

## Decision
* Build for fun.

## Consequences
* IDE?
* Language processor?
* Syntax highlight?

## Alternatives Considered (Optional)
- Use another language 
  - OCaml
  - Kotlin
  - C# with framework
    - EventFlow
    - DDD Toolkit
