# Cobble Lang
A small self-made scripting language made for fun trying to use Extreme Programming practices

## Inspirations

### Java
* I love java's type system because it makes reasoning about a program easier
* I love java's classes (minus a bit of boilerplate)
* I love how maven makes you write tests in the project you write the code for.
* I love how java's IDEs auto import files when you code
* I love how java's IDEs do auto complete
* I like annotation based event systems
* I don't like how magic annotations are sometimes
* I like Lombok Getters & Setters even tho elegant objects are really against them
* I like how java with maven does module management
* I like exception bubbling
* I like exposing exceptions in the method signature 
* I don't like the flow of exceptions tho with try catch
* I love brackets to declare scope
* I'm not too big of a fan of inheritance
* I do like interfaces, but I think they are too busy at times and too much work prefer them auto generated

### Javascript
* I love how it runs anywhere
* I'm not a fan of passing functions into functions
* I love npm for quickly installing packages
* I like how it's single threaded a lot of the time
* I like how it can be run on lamba functions online

### Lua
* I love how it maps to c code so easily
* I like how few keywords it has
* I don't like how it does event drive code

### Other
I like the principle of immutability in functions
I like the idea of domain driven design
I like the idea of test driven development (starting with behaviours)

## Example code

``` 
var name = "Heath"
Console.writeLine("I am " + name)
```
